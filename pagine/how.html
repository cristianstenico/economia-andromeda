This year the Andromeda Art Studio has once again been invited to participate in the 'Festival of Economics', held between June 2nd and 5th in Trento.
The theme for this year is: Where growth takes place.
<br/><br/>
We have decided to put together a presentation that you can visit via our website: <a href="http://www.studioandromeda.net/economia">www.studioandromeda.net</a>.
<br/>
The visitors can vote up to 3 cartoons and, upon the conclusion of the festival, three prizes will be assigned.
<br/>
More information can be found by visiting the homepage of the Provincia Autonoma di Trento and navigating to the official homepage of the 'Festival of Economics' Festival dell'Economia.
